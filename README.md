# Welcome to the Morty-dex!

## Introduction

Hello! This app was inspired by the "Pocket Morty" video game. The app is used to demostrate what I had learned in react. The website is based on the different types of Mortys' that you would encounter in the Pocket Morty game.  


## How to use

Start the system up by typing 

> "yarn start"

then open another terminal and start your server by typing:

> "db.json --watch json-server -p 3001".


## Features(MVP)

The **navbar** is located on the top of the screen and is an easy way to access the application. 

Starting off with the **home page**, the data will display with a picture of each Morty that exists in the Morty-dex.

On the home page where the Mortys' are displayed, you have the ability to delete Morty's of your choice. The application will update automatically without refreshing the page. 

There is a new Morty form that is accessable using the Navigation bar. Once the information is submitted by pressing the submit button, the application will navigate the user to the home page where the new Morty will display.  

The last feature is the search bar which is located on the right side of the Navigation bar. The search feature is able to filter through the list of Mortys and return the Morty's that match your input value.  


## Stretch Goals

Feature to edit an existing Morty.
